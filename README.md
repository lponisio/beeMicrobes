# beeMicrobes
Analysis code for community analysis of bee micro- and patho-biomes 

The data accompanies the code for reproducibility, but we ask to be contacted (lponisio@gmail.com and hamutahlc@gmail.com) if authors wish to use the data for a publication.

In our study we examine the microbiome and pathobiome dynamics of wild pollinator communities using variety of different methods including 1) baseyian analyses and 2) network analyses. We are committed to reproducible science and all analytical code will be maintained on github.

The entire analysis is executable from the main.sh file. All of the packages needed to run the analyses are listed in the packages.sh file. All analyses were run using R (version 3.5.1).


Navigate to the analysis folder within the github repo ) then the main.sh file can be selected and run, you could run all of the analyses in the study by running this line in BASH.

This will somewhat helpfully print the results of each analysis and re-create any accompanying figures.
